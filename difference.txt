PS: I think it is easy to see what I wrote in the file since I will define the name of function likecleanText, WindowSelect----> combine of several words with uppercase letter.

and below I will introduce the differences between your and mine. Hopely this can help you.
In the Pad.py file:
 	before class Pad, I add a function cleanText,	
	in the class pad: I defined some variable for pad, you can find them in def _init_()
			  function: PreprocessOperationByAuthor,  get_text_by_author, PlotLengthOper			      ationTime, RejectOutliers, PlotSimilarityDistribution, selectTimeInterval\			  BuildWindowOperation, getTextByWin,computeDistance, windowSort, merge,Plot			      TextAdded, 
	And all things in Class WindowOperation.
In the Operation.py:
	in class operation:
		I add self.text valuable in def _init(), function getOpText,
