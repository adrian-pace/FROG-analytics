Pace  : Cluster
Louis : Patterns, compare pads with similar
Pace  : correlation between metrics, PCa?


Louis : are there more difference between time or between groups
Louis : how metrics evolve during time PER PAD
Louis : see the average break between elem operations to find optimal delay between ops
Louis : explain choices for parameters
Louis : plot the length of the op to find the optimal edit size
Louis : plot the length of the op to find the optimal depending on the edit size
