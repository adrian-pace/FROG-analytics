Patterns, compare pads with similar 
correlation between metrics, PCa?


are there more difference between time or between groups
how metrics evolve during time PER PAD
see the average break between elem operations to find optimal delay between ops
explain choices for parameters
plot the length of the op to find the optimal edit size
plot the length of the op to find the optimal depending on the edit size
