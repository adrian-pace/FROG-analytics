1. text added per user /win plot  (both window at lease work inside) how many charates

6. docuviz tool 
7. write the report about what I did before (even for some method useless??you did) and the slide 

remove outliers using in range [mean-2*sd,mean+2*sd]
: build a 3D heatmap of similarity for paragraphs
can you plot the structure of 'paragraph'
